## Description
This project is a note taking application, once a note is created it is saved. I had a lot of trouble with this application but using the Hot Restaurant example I finally got this app to work. The biggest trouble areas for me were syncing up the front and back end for this application but eventually using express I managed to get them linked. While I have managed to get the note writing function to work I have not managed to get the deletion figured out yet so that is where my next steps will be with this project.
